>=13.1.0
--------

* The Telegraf module for the Manager allows for sending statistics to
  an Telegraf Agent over TCP, UDP or a UNIX Socket. Telegraf can then
  send the statistics to databases like InfluxDB, ElasticSearch, Graphite
  and many more.

* The graylog fields naming the originator of a log event have
  changed: the string-form name is now included (e.g., ``"name":
  "mgr.foo"``), and the rank-form name is now in a nested section
  (e.g., ``"rank": {"type": "mgr", "num": 43243}``).

* If the cluster log is directed at syslog, the entries are now
  prefixed by both the string-form name and the rank-form name (e.g.,
  ``mgr.x mgr.12345 ...`` instead of just ``mgr.12345 ...``).
